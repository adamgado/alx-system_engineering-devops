Command line for the win

I used the sftp link from the sandbox to open it on my local terminal

then I used ls and cd to navigate to this dirctory
and used lls and lcd to navigate to the folder I had containing the screenshots

the I used put followed by the name of each screenshot file to copy it to this directory
(not sure if I could do a select all method but I couldn't make it work)

then I exited sftp on my local terminal because it was slow and went back to using the sandbox directly to commit and push
